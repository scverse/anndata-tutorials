    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "    - `X`: The dataset to be written.\n",
    "    - `shape`: Descriptive shape of the dataset.\n",
    "    - `array_name`: Name representing the type of array (e.g., \"np\", \"csc\", \"csr\").\n",

    "#### 2. `write_temp_data`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is designed to write temporary data based on the specified parameters to the output directory. It iteratively generates data sets based on shapes, sizes, densities, and number of runs, and writes each dataset to a Zarr format file using the `write_data_to_zarr` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "    - `shapes`: List of dataset shapes (e.g., \"fat\", \"tall\", \"square\").\n",
